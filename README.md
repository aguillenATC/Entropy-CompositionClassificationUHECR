#  Entropy-CompositionClassificationUHECR


This project is for the paper submitted to Entropy journal entitled Composition Classification of Ultra-High EnergyCosmic Rays, it performs variable selection and model design to classify (multi-class) the type of particle in an event of UHECR.

Original data includes the following variables:

1 NALLParticlesTotal: number of particles generated at ground level

2 MUTotal: number of muons

3 ELTOTAL: Number of em particles

4 X_max: g/cm^2 Point in the atmosphere where the particle generates maximum number of interactions
 
5 Zenith: Zenith angle of the particle in degrees

6 Energy: Particle energy in GeV

7 Zfirst : Altitude of the particle's first interaction
